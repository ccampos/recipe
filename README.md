Recipe
======

On first thought, I'd like to be able to input ingredients including quantity
and partition style, then input preparation.

Subsequently, to store recipe and be able to edit it. Then, to search through
recipes.

Trying to figure out how to display ingredients and steps.

Is the best way to display ingredients dynamically, how to format them for iphone by aisle order?
