Recipe
======

On first thought, I'd like to be able to input ingredients including quantity
and partition style, then input preparation.

Subsequently, to store recipe and be able to edit it. Then, to search through
recipes.

Trying to figure out how to display ingredients and steps.

Apparently preparation list is working fine the way it is.

Ingredient list may need to be sorte by aisle, or maybe not.
